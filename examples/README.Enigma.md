**ATPy** for ENIGMA
===================

O Brave man!  You've come so far, don't let it slip away...


Quick start
-----------

Performance analysis tools for Linux *perf* must be installed.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ai4reason/atpy.git
$ cd atpy/examples
$ tar xzf enigma.tar.gz
$ cd enigma
$ ./example.sh
```

The example trains an Enigma predictor using accuracy-balancing boosting and
directed looping.  It evaluates the original and all the intermediate
predictors on a training set of 50 MZR problems.  It prints numbers of
processed clauses and the summary of solved problems.

Always run the example directly as above from the `enigma` directory and do
not mess about with the directory structure (unless you read the Usage).


Requirements
------------

Performance analysis tools for Linux *perf* must be installed on your
system.  Additionally, you need AI4Reason fork of E with Enigma support, and
LIBLINEAR.  You can use binaries provided in `bin/` compiled for x86 (you
still need to install *perf* from your distribution repository), or you
can obtain it from github, like this:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ai4reason/eprover.git
$ cd eprover
$ git fetch
$ git checkout ENIGMA
```

Then compile E and (included) LIBLINEAR:

```console
$ ./configure
$ make 
$ cd CONTRIB/liblinear
$ make
```

You need the following binaries in your `PATH` for **ATPy** to work:

```
PROVER/eprover
SIMPLE_APPS/enigma-features
CONTRIB/liblinear/train
CONTRIB/liblinear/predict
```


Installation
------------

Directory `atpy` must be added to your `PYTHONPATH`.


Usage
-----

Note: E _strategies_ are sometimes called _protocols_, from historical
reasons.

Once you have **ATPy** in PYTHONPATH, you can import it in Python:

```python
from atpy import *
```

Use `loop.py` and `example.sh` from `enigma.tar.gz` for an inspiration (see Quick start).

**ATPy** and an Enigma-inside E Prover make use of the following environment
variables which should be set appropriately.

+ `ENIGMA_ROOT`: Directory with Enigma models.
+ `EXPRES_PROTOS`: Directory with E strategies.
+ `EXPRES_BENCHMARKS`: Directory with benchmark problems.
+ `EXPRES_RESULTS`: Directory with E output files.
+ `EXPRES_SOLVED`: Directory with the database of solved problems for each
  strategy.

The following terminology is used in the code base:

+ `pid` is a _protocol id_, a file name relative to `EXPRES_PROTOS` which
  contains E command line options.  Do not use `/` in `pid` name.
  Additionally, `pid` can start with `Enigma+` and then it is looked up in
  `ENIGMA_ROOT` directory.
+ `pids` is list of `pid`s (`[pid]`).
+ `bid` is a _benchmark id_, a directory name relative `EXPRES_BENCHMARKS`
  which contains TPTP benchmark problems.  `bid` can contain `/`.
+ `results` is a collection (set, list, map, ...) of result keys (`rkey`),
  where each `rkey` is tuple `(pid,bid,problem,limit)` and it represents the
  results of running `pid` on `problem` from benchmark `bid` with time limit
  `limit`.  The corresponding E output file is in
  `EXPRES_RESULTS/bid/pid/limit`.

The following are the key function of **ATPy** for Enigma:

+ `expres.benchmarks.eval(bid, pids, limit)`: Evaluate strategies `pids` on
  benchmark `bid` with `limit`, and return `results` as a map from `rkeys`
  to parsed results.
+ `enigma.models.smartboost(name, results)`: Create model from training data
  `results`, use accuracy-balancing boosting, and put the result in
  `ENIGMA_ROOT/name`.
+ `enigma.protos.standalone(pid, name)`: Enrich strategy `pid` with Enigma
  model `name`, override any previous clause selection mechanism in `pid` to
  use Enigma predictor `name`.  Return new `pid`.
+ `enigma.protos.combined(pid, name)`: As above, but combine `name` with
  the clause selection from `pid`.
+ `expres.dump.solved(bid, pids, results, ref)`: Dump the number of problems
  from `bid` solved by each `pid` from `pids` with an optional reference
  `pid`.  Results must be already evaluated.
